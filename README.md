# About


The integrated transportation service platform is an information system that combines various services and functionalities aimed at facilitating the process of servicing vehicles. This platform provides a wide range of services for both vehicle owners and auto services, creating convenient and efficient interaction between them.

The main components of the integrated transportation service platform include several key aspects:
1) The user interface plays an important role, providing convenient access to all platform functions. An intuitive web interface and easy access to information about available auto services will save users time and make the servicing process more efficient.
2) The authentication and account management module ensures security and convenience in managing data, including user profiles and vehicle information.
3) Managing auto services and work schedules allows users to easily choose a suitable time and place for servicing, as well as receive up-to-date information on prices and promotions.
4) The service request management module and notification of request status enhance customer satisfaction and provide transparency in the servicing process.
5) Managing personnel and vehicles helps auto services efficiently organize their work and ensure a high level of service.

## Technologies


The integrated transportation service platform leverages a diverse set of technologies to deliver its functionality:
1) C#: The primary programming language providing robustness and versatility.
2) ASP.NET Core: A powerful framework for building web applications and APIs, offering scalability and performance.
3) Clean Architecture: A software design pattern that promotes separation of concerns and maintainability.
4) Domain-Driven Design (DDD): A methodology for modeling complex software systems based on the business domain.
5) MSSQL: A relational database management system used for storing and managing data.
6) EF Core: Entity Framework Core, an object-relational mapper for .NET applications, facilitating database interaction.
7) Blazor: A web framework for building interactive web UIs using C# and .NET, enabling client-side and server-side development.
8) MudBlazor: A Blazor component library providing pre-designed UI components for rapid development.
9) JWT Bearer Token: JSON Web Tokens used for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to resources.
10) Fluent Validation: A .NET library for defining and executing validation rules, enhancing data integrity.
11) ErrorOr: A pattern for handling success or error outcomes in a functional programming style.
12) Mapster: A library for object mapping and conversion, simplifying data transformation tasks.
13) Mediator: A behavioral design pattern used for decoupling components and orchestrating interactions.
14) Serilog: A logging library for .NET applications, offering structured logging capabilities.
15) Leaflet: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps, providing geospatial visualization features.
16) Patterns: Various design patterns such as unit of work, generic repository, and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), employed to structure and optimize the codebase.
